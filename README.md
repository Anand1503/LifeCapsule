# LifeCapsule
LifeCapsule is an app that allows users to document daily events and easily query past memories using natural language. It combines a React frontend, Flask backend, and LangChain with a local LLM (e.g., Llama 3.2) for efficient querying and memory management, offering personalized insights into life experiences.
