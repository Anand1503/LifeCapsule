# LifeCapsule Codebase Cleanup - Progress Tracker

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Project Structure Analysis
- [x] Analyzed the entire codebase structure
- [x] Identified duplicate and unwanted files
- [x] Mapped out the organized structure

### 2. File Organization
- [x] **Reorganized components** into proper folder structure:

  - Duplicate component files in src/components/
  - Duplicate page files in src/pages/
  - Empty directories (docs/, frontend/components/ui/)
- [x] **Removed temporary files**:
  - Response files with UUIDs
  - Unused setup files (start-frontend.bat)
  - Duplicate TODO files
- [x] **Cleaned up project root**:
  - Removed empty directories
  - Kept essential files only

### 4. Project Structure Verification
- [x] **Verified clean structure**:
  - Maintained backend/ directory
  - Kept data/ directory with diary.txt
  - Preserved public/ directory for static assets
  - Organized src/ with proper component/page structure
