Today was a productive day at college. We had a detailed lecture on Data Structures, and I finally understood trees better. Spent the evening gaming with friends, which was a nice break.


August 16, 2024:
Finished a challenging assignment for my Machine Learning course. It took longer than expected, but I feel accomplished. Played a couple of rounds of Valorant to relax.


August 17, 2024:
Participated in an e-sports tournament today! It was intense, but our team managed to win a couple of rounds. Feeling a bit tired now, but it was worth it.


August 18, 2024:
Had a long day with back-to-back lectures. Managed to squeeze in some time to practice a few coding problems. My eyes feel a bit strained after gaming later in the evening.


August 19, 2024:
The presentation prep for our group project is coming along well. Also, watched a tutorial on Unity; I’m slowly getting the hang of game development. I felt a little under the weather, but nothing too concerning.


August 20, 2024:
Today started with some meditation, which really helped me focus during the day. Went to the gym in the evening, and it felt good to move around after hours of coding.


August 21, 2024:
Finally submitted my Machine Learning project. It was a relief to get it done. Celebrated by playing a marathon gaming session. I might have overdone it as my wrist feels a little sore.


August 22, 2024:
Woke up feeling anxious about the upcoming tournament. Managed to channel that energy into preparing strategies with my team. Played a couple of test matches, and I think we're ready!


August 23, 2024:
The coding session today was great; I solved a couple of tough problems on LeetCode. It’s satisfying to see progress. Took some time off to unwind with a short walk.


August 24, 2024:
Had a stiff neck this morning, probably from sleeping wrong. Attended a fun lecture on AI principles, and the professor shared some interesting case studies. Ended the day with some casual gaming with friends.
